        <h3>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems.</h3>
        
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. </p>

        <p>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crudty garlic bread. </p>
